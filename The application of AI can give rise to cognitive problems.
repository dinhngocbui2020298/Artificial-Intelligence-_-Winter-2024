The application of AI can give rise to cognitive problems. We see this in AI software used for image recognition, facial recognition,
medical diagnosis through images or fake videos and images (deepfakes). These applications are currently receiving public attention for the
accuracy of the results as well as its ability to perform beyond the human ability to recognize right from wrong.

The application of artificial intelligence in automating the process of making predictions and decisions, such as assisting humans in making 
recommendations about hate speech or detecting spam. The development of artificial intelligence is not perfect and it is still in the process of
perfecting itself to try to imitate human reasoning. The view that “AI will never be like humans” raises concerns that the consequences of errors
and deviations related to ethical issues ar
e inevitable.
