What is AI ?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science. It is a branch of intelligence created by humans with the goal of helping computers automate intelligent behaviors like humans. 
Specifically, artificial intelligence helps computers acquire human intelligence such as: knowing how to think and reason to solve problems, knowing how to communicate by understanding language, speech, knowing how to learn and adapt, etc. 
AI technology creates intelligent machines and systems through the use of computer models, engineering and related technologies, helping to perform tasks that require human intelligence. In general, this is a very broad field of study, including elements of psychology,
computer science and engineering. Some common examples of AI include self-driving cars, automatic translation software, virtual assistants on phones or virtual opponents when playing games on phones.
